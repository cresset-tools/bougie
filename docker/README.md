# bougie container images

Published to GitHub Container Registry on every release:

| Image | Base | Use |
|-------|------|-----|
| `ghcr.io/cresset-tools/bougie:<version>` | `scratch` | Binary-only. Lift `/bougie` + `/bgx` into your own image. |
| `ghcr.io/cresset-tools/bougie:latest` | `scratch` | Same, tracking the latest stable release. |
| `ghcr.io/cresset-tools/bougie:<version>-debian-slim` | `debian:trixie-slim` | Runnable, glibc (fully functional on amd64 — see below). |
| `ghcr.io/cresset-tools/bougie:<version>-alpine` | `alpine:3.22` | Runnable, **musl/Alpine** (fully functional on amd64 — see below). |

Stable releases also publish rolling `<major>.<minor>` and bare-variant tags
(`debian-slim`, `alpine`); prereleases publish only the exact `<version>` /
`<version>-<variant>` tags.

Both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` are published as a single multi-arch
manifest, so `docker pull` / `FROM` / `COPY --from` resolve the right arch
automatically.

## Telemetry

Published images set `BOUGIE_TELEMETRY=off`: containers never prompt and
never send, and no consent file can end up baked into an image layer. The
default is overridable wherever you run the image — `docker run -e
BOUGIE_TELEMETRY=on …`, a compose `environment:` entry, or a GitHub Actions
`env:` block (an explicit `on` deliberately wins over CI detection; events
carry `ci: true`). Because the env var outranks the on-disk mode file, use
the env override rather than `bougie telemetry on` inside the container —
`bougie telemetry status` names which source decided. Full policy:
[TELEMETRY.md](../TELEMETRY.md).

## Platform support for `php install`

The `bougie` binary runs on every published image/arch. Fetching a **PHP
runtime** depends on what bougie's distribution index (`index.bougie.tools`)
ships: **`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` and `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`** (plus
`aarch64-apple-darwin`, irrelevant to Linux containers). So `php install`
works on **both glibc and musl on amd64** — Alpine included. Only arm64 Linux
PHP isn't in the index yet.

| Image / arch | `bougie` runs | `bougie php install` |
|--------------|:--:|:--:|
| `debian-slim` · amd64 | ✓ | ✓ |
| `alpine` · amd64 | ✓ | ✓ |
| `debian-slim` · arm64 | ✓ | ✗ — no `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` in the index yet |
| `alpine` · arm64 | ✓ | ✗ — no `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` in the index yet |

Both amd64 runnable images — **`debian-slim` and `alpine`** — are fully
functional today (the index gained `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` in
php-build-standalone 0.2.5). The arm64 variants are published ahead of the
index: once php-build-standalone ships the `aarch64-*-linux-*` builds they
become functional with no image changes. On Apple Silicon, Docker Desktop runs
the amd64 image under Rosetta, so both variants work there too.

## Copy the binary into your own image

The `scratch` image exists to be a source for `COPY --from` — the binaries
are static (no libc), so they run in whatever stage you copy them into:

```dockerfile
FROM debian:trixie-slim
COPY --from=ghcr.io/cresset-tools/bougie:latest /bougie /bgx /usr/local/bin/
# bougie's multi-call argv[0] roles (php, composer, bougied, bougie-babysit)
# all live on the single /bougie binary; `bougie sync` creates the shims.
```

## Run bougie directly

Use a runnable variant — the bare `scratch` image has **no CA certificates**,
so it can't fetch PHP runtimes over TLS. Both `debian-slim` (glibc) and
`alpine` (musl) are fully functional on amd64:

```sh
# Debian (glibc)
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/app" -w /app ghcr.io/cresset-tools/bougie:debian-slim sync
# Alpine (musl) — installs the musl PHP runtime from the index
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/app" -w /app ghcr.io/cresset-tools/bougie:alpine sync
```

## How the images are built

The images are built with [Depot](https://depot.dev) (project `ngljfb827z`, see
`depot.json`), which provides native per-arch builders for both `linux/amd64`
and `linux/arm64` — no QEMU, no cross-compile, no arm runner.

`docker/Dockerfile` compiles natively on each arch: the `build` stage runs on
`rust:<ver>-alpine`, so musl is the native libc and a plain `cargo build
--release` yields a fully static binary. The final `scratch` stage runs no code
— it just holds the native-arch binaries.

just-built base binaries onto a real OS base; its only `RUN` is the per-base CA
certificate install, which Depot's native arm64 builder runs without emulation.

CI: `.github/workflows/build-docker.yml`, wired into the release as a
post-announce job via `post-announce-jobs` in `dist-workspace.toml`. It also
runs a push-free amd64 smoke build on PRs that touch the Dockerfiles or the
cargo sources.
